# Portfolio UI 
The design of the portfolio is completely custom, without relaying on external libraries. 
Inspired by Google Material Design, with semplicity and efficiency in mind.

> Note that most of the components used in the web app haven't still added, and some need further abstraction. 
> Planned for the next releases.

The objective of this storybook is to test how every component behave singularly, unbinded from the rest of the UI.
